# Tech-Center: A Platform for the College Tech Community

Tech-Center is an internal platform built for the tech community at our college. It provides a space for students to share ideas, solve problems, and learn from each other.

With Tech-Center, users can:

- Get Feedback: Share projects, code, or ideas and receive helpful feedback from peers.
- Ask for Help: Post technical questions and get answers from experienced developers in the community.
- Find Guidance: Connect with mentors and fellow students for advice on projects, career paths, or technical challenges.
- Collaborate: Work together on coding problems, discuss tech topics, and share useful resources.

Tech-Center is designed to make it easier for students to connect, learn, and grow as developers in a supportive environment.
